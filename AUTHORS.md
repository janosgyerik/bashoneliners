Bash One-Liners was originally created in August, 2011 in Paris, France.

The PRIMARY AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Janos Gyerik <info@bashoneliners.com>

Other contributors:

    * Pierre-Jean Baraud
    * Noah Spahn

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made bashoneliners that much better:

    * Ivan Zimine
    * Mal Page

A big THANK YOU goes to:

    Django, for making this project really easy.

    jQuery, for making all the JavaScript magic really easy.

    John Bintz, who kindly let go of his @bashoneliners twitter account for us!
