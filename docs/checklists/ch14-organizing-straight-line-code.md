Chapter 14: Organizing Straight Line Code
=========================================

Checklist: Organizing Straight Line Code
----------------------------------------

- Does the code make dependencies among statements obvious?

- Do the names of routines make dependencies obvious?

- Do parameters to routines make dependencies obvious?

- Do comments describe any dependencies that would otherwise be
  unclear?

- Have housekeeping variables been used to check for sequential
  dependencies in critical sections of code?

- Does the code read from top to bottom?

- Are related statements grouped together?

- Have relatively independent groups of statements been moved into
  their own routines?
