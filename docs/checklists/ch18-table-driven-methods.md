Chapter 18: Table Driven Methods
================================

Checklist: Table Driven Methods
-------------------------------

- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to
  complicated logic?

- Have you considered table-driven methods as an alternative to
  complicated inheritance structures?

- Have you considered storing the table's data externally and reading
  it at run time so that the data can be modified without changing
  code?

- If the table cannot be accessed directly via a straightforward array
  index (as in the Age example), have your put the access-key
  calculation into a routine rather than duplicating the index
  calculation in the code?
