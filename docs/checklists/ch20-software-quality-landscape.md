Chapter 20: Software Quality Landscape
======================================

Checklist: A Quality-Assurance Plan
-----------------------------------

- Have you identified specific quality characteristics that are
  important to your project?

- Have you made others aware of the projects quality objectives?

- Have you differentiated between external and internal quality
  characteristics?

- Have you thought about the ways in which some characteristics may
  compete with or complement others?

- Does your project call for the use of several different
  error-detection techniques suited to finding several different kinds
  of errors?

- Does your project include a plan to take steps to assure software
  quality during each stage of software development?

- Is the quality measured in some way so that you can tell whether its
  improving or degrading?

- Does management understand that quality assurance incurs additional
  costs up front in order to save costs later?
