Chapter 21: Collaborative Construction
======================================

Checklist: Effective Pair Programming
-------------------------------------

- Do you have a coding standard to support pair programming that's
  focused on programming rather than on philosophical coding-style
  discussions?

- Are both partners participating actively?

- Are you avoiding pair programming everything, instead selecting the
  assignments that will really benefit from pair programming?

- Are you rotating pair assignments and work assignments regularly?

- Are the pairs well matched in terms of pace and personality?

- Is there a team leader to act as the focal point for management and
  other people outside the project?

Checklist: Effective Inspections
--------------------------------

- Do you have checklists that focus reviewer attention on areas that
  have been problems in the past?

- Is the emphasis on defect detection rather than correction?

- Are inspectors given enough time to prepare before the inspection
  meeting, and is each one prepared?

- Does each participant have a distinct role to play?

- Does the meeting move at a productive rate?

- Is the meeting limited to two hours?

- Has the moderator received specific training in conducting
  inspections?

- Is data about error types collected at each inspection so that you
  can tailor future checklists to your organization?

- Is data about preparation and inspection rates collected so that you
  can optimize future preparation and inspections?

- Are the action items assigned at each inspection followed up, either
  personally by the moderator or with a re-inspection?

- Does management understand that it should not attend inspection
  meetings?
