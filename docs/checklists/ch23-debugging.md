Chapter 23: Debugging
=====================

Checklist: Debugging Reminders
------------------------------

### Techniques for Finding Defects

- Use all the data available to make your hypothesis

- Refine the test cases that produce the error

- Exercise the code in your unit test suite

- Use available tools

- Reproduce the error several different ways

- Generate more data to generate more hypotheses

- Use the results of negative tests

- Brainstorm for possible hypotheses

- Narrow the suspicious region of the code

- Be suspicious of classes and routines that have had defects before

- Check code thats changed recently

- Expand the suspicious region of the code

- Integrate incrementally

- Check for common defects

- Talk to someone else about the problem

- Take a break from the problem

- Set a maximum time for quick and dirty debugging

- Make a list of brute force techniques, and use them

### Techniques for Syntax Errors

- Don't trust line numbers in compiler messages

- Don't trust compiler messages

- Don't trust the compilers second message

- Divide and conquer

- Find extra comments and quotation marks

### Techniques for Fixing Defects

- Understand the problem before you fix it

- Understand the program, not just the problem

- Confirm the defect diagnosis

- Relax

- Save the original source code

- Fix the problem, not the symptom

- Change the code only for good reason

- Make one change at a time

- Check your fix

- Look for similar defects

### General Approach to Debugging

- Do you use debugging as an opportunity to learn more about your
  program, mistakes, code quality, and problem-solving approach?

- Do you avoid the trial-and-error, superstitious approach to
  debugging?

- Do you assume that errors are your fault?

- Do you use the scientific method to stabilize intermittent errors?

- Do you use the scientific method to find defects?

- Rather than using the same approach every time, do you use several
  different techniques to find defects?

- Do you verify that the fix is correct?

- Do you use compiler warning
