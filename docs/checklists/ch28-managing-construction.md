Chapter 28: Managing Construction
=================================

Checklist: Configuration Management
-----------------------------------

### General

- Is your software-configuration-management plan designed to help
  programmers and minimize overhead?

- Does your SCM approach avoid overcontrolling the project?

- Do you group change requests, either through informal means such as
  a list of pending changes or through a more systematic approach such
  as a change-control board?

- Do you systematically estimate the effect of each proposed change?

- Do you view major changes as a warning that requirements development
  isn't yet complete?

### Tools

- Do you use version-control software to facilitate configuration
  management?

- Do you use version-control software to reduce coordination problems
  of working in teams?

### Backup

- Do you back up all project materials periodically?

- Are project backups transferred to off-site storage periodically?

- Are all materials backed up, including source code, documents,
  graphics, and important notes?

- Have you tested the backup-recovery procedure?
