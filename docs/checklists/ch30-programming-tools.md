Chapter 30: Programming Tools
=============================

Checklist: Programming Tools
----------------------------

- Do you have an effective IDE?

- Does your IDE support outline view of your program; jumping to
  definitions of classes, routines, and variables; source code
  formatting; brace matching or begin-end matching; multiple file
  string search and replace; convenient compilation; and integrated
  debugging?

- Do you have tools that automate common refactorings?

- Are you using version control to manage source code, content,
  requirements, designs, project plans, and other project artifacts?

- If you're working on a very large project, are you using a data
  dictionary or some other central repository that contains
  authoritative descriptions of each class used in the system?

- Have you considered code libraries as alternatives to writing custom
  code, where available?

- Are you making use of an interactive debugger?

- Do you use make or other dependency-control software to build
  programs efficiently and reliably?

- Does your test environment include an automated test framework,
  automated test generators, coverage monitors, system perturbers,
  diff tools, and defect tracking software?

- Have you created any custom tools that would help support your
  specific project's needs, especially tools that automate repetitive
  tasks?

- Overall, does your environment benefit from adequate tool support?
